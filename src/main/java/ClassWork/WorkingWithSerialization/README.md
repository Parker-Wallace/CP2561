# Exercise

Using the 2nd May 21st Exercise as a starter, modify the guess game logging and analysis to use Serialization.

You can use the files on d2l under "Exercise Solution", or you can use your own code as the starter.

Modify the first exercise to output an xml file which uses JAXB serialization for each game log.

For the program which analyzes the game log, use JAXB de-serialization to load xml into an object which represents the game log.

Hints:

You will need to create a new class which represents a game log and is a POJO
