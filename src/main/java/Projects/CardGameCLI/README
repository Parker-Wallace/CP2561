the idea
server - the dealer
sends out a port that listens
can have multiple games (threads) going at the sametime
sends cards to the client and pays out based on responses

client - the player
connects to port listener
can instantiate multiple games
plays blackjack (hit/stay/bet)

if implementing a GUI render it client side
