# Assignment #4 Java Collections ( 19 Marks )

1. Explain why inserting additional elements into an ArrayList
object whose current size is less than its capacity is a relatively fast
operation and why inserting additional elements into an ArrayList
object whose current size is at its capacity is a relatively slow operation.

2. Briefly answer the following questions:
    1. What is the primary difference between a Set and a Map?
    2. What happens when you add a primitive type (e.g., double)
    value to a collection?
    3. Can you print all the elements in a collection without using an
    Iterator? If yes, how?

3. Rewrite lines 10–25 in Fig. 16.3 to be more concise by using the
asList method and the LinkedList constructor that takes a
Collection argument.( File ListTest.java contains the original code to modify)

4. (Copying and Reversing LinkedLists) Write a program that
creates a LinkedList object of 10 characters, then creates a second
LinkedList object containing a copy of the first list, but in reverse
order.

5. (Changing a PriorityQueue’s Sort Order) The output of Fig.
16.14 shows that Priority-Queue orders Double elements in
ascending order. Rewrite Fig. 16.14 so that it orders Double elements in
descending order (i.e., 9.8 should be the highest-priority element rather
than 3.2).(File PriorityQueueTest.java contains the original code to modify
